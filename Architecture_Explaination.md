# Temporal Graph Attention Networks with Dynamic Memory (TempGAT)

## Core Architecture

The model extends Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with temporal dynamics through a novel approach:

1. **Temporal Discretization**: Rather than processing the entire graph simultaneously, the model segments the social media activity timeline into fixed temporal windows (e.g., 15-minute intervals), creating a sequence of graph "snapshots."

2. **Dynamic Node Participation**: Each snapshot contains only actively participating nodes within that time window. This creates variable-sized adjacency matrices across snapshots, as the number of active nodes fluctuates over time.

3. **Symmetric Masking for Asymmetric Interactions**: To handle the mathematical challenges of variable-sized matrices in deep learning operations, the model applies symmetric masking to the fundamentally asymmetric social media interactions, enabling proper gradient propagation while preserving directional information.

4. **Localized GAT Operations**: The standard GAT attention mechanism operates efficiently on each snapshot's significantly reduced node set, computing embeddings based on local graph structure.

5. **Temporal State Propagation**: As the model advances to subsequent snapshots:
   - Nodes persisting across snapshots carry forward their updated embeddings and attention weights
   - Nodes becoming inactive are transferred to a memory bank
   - Previously inactive nodes re-entering the graph retrieve their stored embeddings from the memory bank

6. **Memory Persistence Mechanism**: The memory bank serves as a stateful repository, preserving node embeddings during periods of inactivity, allowing the model to maintain long-term dependencies without the computational cost of processing the entire graph.

## Computational Efficiency Gains

This architecture achieves efficiency through three key mechanisms:

1. **Reduced Computation Space**: By processing only active nodes in each snapshot rather than the entire graph
2. **Temporal Locality**: Focusing attention mechanisms on temporally relevant interactions
3. **Stateful Memory**: Avoiding recomputation of embeddings for returning nodes

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing this architecture, address these critical aspects:

1. **Masking Strategy**: Ensure symmetric masking enables GAT operations without distorting the directional nature of attention weights. This requires careful implementation to preserve asymmetric influence patterns within a mathematically symmetric framework.

2. **Embedding Continuity**: When nodes reappear from the memory bank, normalize their embeddings to prevent disproportionate influence from historical interactions. Consider implementing a time-decay factor for stored embeddings.

3. **Memory Management**: Implement a pruning mechanism for the memory bank to prevent state explosion in long-running models. Options include:
   - Time-based decay of stored embeddings
   - Activity-threshold pruning for rarely active nodes
   - Dimensionality reduction for long-term storage

4. **Empty Snapshot Handling**: Design explicit handling for edge cases where a snapshot contains zero active nodes, perhaps by:
   - Skipping empty time intervals
   - Implementing a minimum node requirement
   - Sampling from memory bank when activity falls below threshold

5. **Initialization Strategy**: Carefully consider how new nodes (with no prior history) are initialized, as this will significantly impact early model performance.

This architecture's primary innovation lies in its efficient handling of temporal dynamics in large graphs through selective computation and persistent memory, making it particularly well-suited for social media analysis where activity patterns are highly sporadic.
